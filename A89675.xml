            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That men should see God face to face in this life, &amp;c.</hi> I urged Scriptures contradictory to his assertion, quoting <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20. where God tells <hi>Moses, Thou canst not see my face, and live; for there shall no man see me, and live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereto he answered, <hi>No man living under the dispensation that Moses lived in, could see Gods face, and live, but that did not hinder but that others that lived under other dispensations might see it:</hi> To this, as I was about to reply, (That not only <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> that lived under the Gospel-dispensation (as I expect no other dispensation in this life) did contradict him in that, as appeared from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. where it is said of God, that, <hi>He only hath immortality, dwelling in the light, which no man can approach unto: whom no man hath seen, nor can see, &amp;c.</hi>) He exprest a desire, that no more might be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for he had a great journey to go, and therefore must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten: hereupon I easily surceased, and after a civil salute pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed betwixt us, he invited me to his Quarters at <hi>Bridgend,</hi> thither I came with thoughts to debate the business privately; but he desired, that not a word might be spoken concerning it; I held it not civil for me to press him to it, in his own chamber, and after a short stay, I took my leave, and departed; from which very place, he writes to me, <hi>That he did purpose to speak at Cowbridge</hi> on Revel. 20.12. <hi>the Scripture,</hi> as he said, <hi>so carnally interpreted by me before many ignorant, and some wise Christians; and if I pleased to have it so, he would admit of a private conference there:</hi> To this I returned an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; That seeing he did deliver such things in publique, as I conceived not to be truths, it stood him upon to maintain them in publique; and if he pleased I was ready to engage him on these four Questions.

            <p>These Questions I sent to him, giving him sufficient time to furnish himself with the best arguments he could; And on the twenty eighth day of the seventh Month he came to <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg,</hi> where he began to speak from <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12. but very little to that Scripture; but after the needless repetition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things out of his printed Book, <note place="margin">Sword dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</note> he takes occasion to fasten all the reproaches he could on the <hi>Presbyterians, Independants,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> saying, <hi>If men could see their hearts, there was nothing but blood and murder in them against any that were not of their judgment:</hi> which did not a little please the many Royalists that were there present; After this, he proceeded to argue, but upon three things (as he writes to Mr <hi>Walter.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the New-Jerusalem is a state of Saints in this life.</hi> Which I profess upon the word of a Christian was not the full question; for I am of this judgment, that the <hi>New-Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> is a State of Saints in this life; and that I did deliver pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly there, that it is begun here; and that here the Saints have an entrance ministred unto them abundantly into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. Believers have the beginnings, fore-tastes, earnests, and seals of their inheritance here; but that they have the full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, and perfect fruition of all the priviledges of the <hi>New-Jerusalem</hi> in this life; or that it is a state to be expected in this life, distinct from a Gospel-ministration, I did, and do deny; and therefore I much wonder that Master <hi>Erb.</hi> is so injurious to himself, as to mutilate the question, and to leave out the most material, and considerable parts of it.</p>
            <p>Two Arguments (as I remember) he brought to prove the Affirmative of this Question.</p>
            <p>One, <hi>Because the Kings of the earth was to bring their glory to it;</hi> Ergo, <hi>It is a State of Saints in this life, distinct from a Gospel-ministration.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:113080:5"/>
            <p>I denyed the Argument, and desired him to prove it, but finding the work too hard, he flies to another <hi>Medium,</hi> and saith in effect,
<q>

            </p>
            <p>Whereto I replyed (as taking the <hi>New-Ierusalem</hi> to be the same with the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) saying, It seems Master <hi>Erburies</hi> judgment is, we shall bring the cattel to Heaven; at which argument of his, <note n="*" place="margin">Riden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The second question was not medled with.</p>
            <p>In the third question Master <hi>Erbury</hi> was negative, having delivered from the Pulpit at <hi>New-castle, That Abraham had no Gospel-faith,</hi> which yet at <hi>Cowbridg</hi> he recanted, and said ingeniously, That that was <hi>Lapsus linguae;</hi> nevertheless he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, and saith as much, as <hi>that the Saints under the Law never knew God in Christ,</hi> contrary to the express words of Scripture, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Who did all drink the same spiritual drink, for they drank of that spiritual rock which followed them, and that rock was Christ:</hi> I asked (if they did not know God in Christ,) By what faith were they justified? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>By a legal faith;</hi> I said, it was no truth to affirm, That any Saint was justified in a legal way (for then justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be by the Law;) He replyed, <hi>It was Perkin's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> but neither would, nor could tell us what part of his works. But how would he needs maintain, that none of the people of God have now a Gospel-faith? <hi>scil.</hi> because they receive Tythes.

Lose not that communion which you have with God in prayer, no, not for your lives; <hi>Praying alwayes with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and supplication for all Saints,</hi> Ephes. 6.18. And seeing the praysing of God is one branch of prayer, I exhort you to be zealous and frequent in that Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal work: The liveliest Emblem of Heaven that I know upon earth, is, when the people of God, in the deep sense of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and bounty, from hearts abounding with love, and joy, do joyn together both in heart, and voyce, in the chearful, and melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious setting forth of his prayses.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let your delight be on the Saints that are in the earth, and upon such as excel in vertue; if you rejoyce in the gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and Communion of Saints on earth, you go the way that leads to the fellowship of Angels, and Saints in Heaven; you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113080:9"/> that have mourned, and fasted, and prayed, and waited together, shall one day joy, and enjoy, and prayse God together. Be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as it is the work of Christ to gather, so it is the Divels act to scatter and divide; I think, he is called Divel, from the latine word <hi>Divello,</hi> which signifies to divide, or pluck asunder.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let all your knowledge run into practise; <hi>If ye know these things, happy are ye, if ye do them, John</hi> 13.17. It will little avail you to be of the true Religion, if you do not conscionably practise the duties of that Religion: Let not the frowns of your potent Neighbours dishearten you, nor the scorners of Religion daunt you, nor the differences of judgments startle you; <hi>Be confident, he which hath begun the good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ, Phil.</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p>And now the Good Lord make you, and me, and all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours serviceable for the building of his Church to the prayse of the Glory of his Grace in Jesus Christ, in whose Name, when you appear before God in Prayer, I beseech you to remember</p>

                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that no Prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation; Now Master <hi>Erbury</hi> gives here a very private interpretation, (whether ye take private, as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to publick, or as opposed to true and divine, if as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to publick;) no Expositor that is extant concurs with him in his judgment; and therefore I shall sooner <hi>acquiesce</hi> in the judgment of <hi>Piscator, Pemble, Diodati, Beza,</hi> and other famous Writers, who expound the three Shepherds to be the three great Empires that had long tyrannized over the Lords people; <hi>scil. Chaldaean, Persian, Graecian,</hi> which the Lord cut off according to his promise, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.39. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 44. The name of Shepherd is applied in Scripture not, to Ministers only, (as some fondly imagine) but to Magistrates, and Governours also, See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.2,3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.17. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Isai.</hi> 44.28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.1. And so I conceive it is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this place; But, observe, the three Shepherds here are said to reflect on the whole Ministy of the Church of England, as Prelates, Presbyters, Independents: These are they (as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Erbury</hi> saith) whom God loaths, and whose souls abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him also; I shall say no more to this, but that the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very acceptable to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Again, if ye take this private interpretation as opposed to true and divine, I conceive it as true, as that <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Welsh</hi> man, or as that Master <hi>Erbury</hi> a <hi>Welsh</hi> man born at <hi>Cardiff</hi> holds parallel with <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> born at <hi>Tarsus;</hi> whereas indeed, the Spirit that then spoke in <hi>Paul</hi> is as far from the Spirit that now speaks in Master <hi>Erbury,</hi> yea, and infinitely farther, then <hi>Jury</hi> is from <hi>Wales,</hi> or <hi>Tarsus</hi> from <hi>Cardiff.</hi>

                  <p>A man may as soon find love, and saving grace in Hell, as find truth in this saying; Surely, if the Christian Churches have fallen from Grace so foully, so finally, as to hate, and abhor Christ, <hi>The gates of Hell have much prevailed against them:</hi> But alas! it is impossible for a Christian Church to fall so; the Church is love-sick after Christ, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8. she calls him her <hi>Wel-beloved, white, and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.22.</note> It cannot be believed that Christ should so far leave, so totally reject the Dearly Beloved of his soul, as to give her over to hate, and abhor him; whom she saith, her soul loveth: But let the Christian Church rejoyce under this slanderous calumny; Christ the Head, and his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Saints have drunk to us in this cup, and we must pledg them; He was called <hi>a Deceiver, Belzebub, a Blasphemer,</hi> and his Saints deemed <hi>the troublers of Israel, and off-scouring of the world:</hi> as now by Master <hi>Erbury, Babylonians, Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Oppressours, Haters of Christ.</hi> Again, it cannot be imagined, that any thing but the Love of Christ constrained the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes to fight against the Dragon; yea, and to overcome him by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.11.

                     <hi>By faith went out, not knowing whether they went.</hi> What but the Love of Christ could work upon their Spirits to leave the Land of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, with many other dear and near relations, and willingly to expose themselves to the mercy of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and the

As the Love of Christ hath first appeared unto them, and even warmed their hearts with the sweet sense thereof: so it hath that magnetical attractive force, that where it is, it will draw up the heavy iron, the gross soul, and make it Heavenly affectionate: there is such a drawing force in this sweet affection of love, that where ever it is, it is reciprocal; and therefore the Christian Churches being the Object of Christs love, must needs love him again.

The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> preached <hi>Christ,</hi> as of the seed of <hi>David,</hi> according to the flesh, the Son of God, made of a woman, made sin, and a curse for us, crucified, and raised again, and now mediating for us with the Father, as our Advocate, High Priest, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of our profession; <note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> in the faith whereof, he doth rejoyce, and place the foundation of all his hope, and confidence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>

                  <p>I might cite many other worthy men, as <hi>Luther, Calvin, Du.

Let Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Preaching go down, but the Ordinances of the Gospel, Baptism, and Lords Supper, be therefore laid aside, let praying to, and praysing of God after meat, with other family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be difused; and how will <hi>Rome</hi> rejoyce, and triumph, when she alone is left Conservatrix, and Depositary of all the holy things of the Gospel? Mr <hi>Erbury</hi> cannot but know, that the powerful preaching of the Word of Truth hath already given such a wound to that Interest in <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the very report thereof makes both the ears of many that hear it to tingle: The blessed effects of Prayer and Preaching, are this day visible and eminent among us, that a man may run and read them in legible characters of desolation,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113080:27"/> and destruction on these mens great houses, and Forts, and say in part, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen;</hi> it is high time then for the Pope to send abroad his Emissaries, to perswade us to lay down our Arms of prayers and tears, he hath felt the effects thereof so fatal, and destructive to his Interest, that I cannot blame his policy to perswade us to give over: But is this a time for Christians to break off that blessed communication which they have with God in prayer, after so many glorious returns of prayers? Is this a time to give over, dividing the bread of life, and word of truth, after so signal a testimony from Heaven going along with it in the conversion of sinners, gathering of Saints, and gain of souls? <hi>Will ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people, and unwise? Deut.</hi> 32.6. For my part, though I look on many gallant persons in the Land, as blessed Instruments in the hands of God to bring about his own glorious work; yet I look upon the poor praying people of God as the most serviceable in their generation for the accomplishment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <note place="margin">Psal. 82.7.</note>

                  <p>I cannot subscribe to him in this, but am of opinion that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Election, yea Personal, is not only near the Gospel, but the very Truth of the Gospel: The Gospel holds it forth; it speaks of Election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. and Elect, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.

Now Mr <hi>John Goodwyn</hi> himself (that holds Universal Redemption) saith in a Dispute with Mr <hi>Simpson. pag.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="inline">That nothing considerable is to be built upon any mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or upon such discourses or discussions, which are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or drawn from the Scriptures, by the interceding, or mediation of reason, or humane understanding.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These very words make against Universal Redemption; which is not to be found in Scripture in express terms, nor yet can it be made out, without the intervention of reason to carry it, as the Doctrine of Election can, and therefore (according to Master <hi>Goodwyn</hi>) it is safer to stand to that course which hath such an express testimony from Scripture: <note place="margin">Matth. 20 16 20</note> The Gospel saith expresly, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, few are elect; the very word Election signifies a separating, and culling out some men from the rest, <hi>John</hi> 15 19 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.2. and the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> writes to elect persons to give all diligence, to make their personal election sure: <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note>
                     <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed, Acts</hi> 13.8. And a man is not ordained to eternal life, because he believes, but he believes because he is ordained to eternal life, See <hi>John</hi> 10.26. <hi>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.</hi> Thus from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I have proved Election (not only Axiomatical, which the <hi>Arminians</hi> grant, but) personal, and there needs no more to beat down Universal Redemption; nevertheless take these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to boot: The first from <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. where the followers of the Lamb are said to be <hi>redeemed from among men;</hi> and if the Saints are redeemed from among men, all men are not redeemed: The Saints are called the <hi>Redeemed of the Lord, Isai.</hi> 53.11. therefore the Redeemed of the Lord cannot be a term communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all: <note place="margin">The Saints, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed of the Lord, are, <hi>Termini co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

See also <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.3,4. See <hi>John</hi> 17.9,10. <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> nor do I think he did pray for them; for, for whom he poured forth his blood, he would not think it much to pour out his prayers. If Christ appeared in his Priestly Office for all upon the Cross, it will follow, that he is now in his Priestly Office for all in Heaven: but he doth not intercede for all, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:113080:29"/> from his prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17. which <hi>Arminius</hi> himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to be the Copy and Pattern of Christs Intercession in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Here then I shall take occasion to deliver these four particulars.</p>
                  <p>And first, I must crave leave to discent from Mr <hi>John Goodwins</hi> division in his Dispute with Mr <hi>Vavasor Powel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag</hi> 10.</note> who to prove universal Redemption from <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>So God loved the world, that whosoever, &amp;c.</hi> he sayth, That,
<q>
                        <hi>Either by the world, there must be meant all Adams posterity, or particularly, those whom you call the Elect.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereto I answer, It is not necessary to restrain the word <hi>World</hi> with limitation to either of these two; for the world is considerable in much more then two respects in Scripture: for first, The World is taken for the whole Creation of Heaven and Earth, with all the creatures therein, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24. <hi>God that made the world, and all things therein, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, It is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the wicked of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.19. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.19. Thirdly, For the visible Church of the <hi>Jews, Matth.</hi> 13.38. The field is the world, wherein there is good seed, and tares; the servants wonder that there are tares in the field: now, it is no wonder to see tears in the wide world, nor had they any call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pluck them up, if they had not been in the visible Church. Fourthly, It is taken for the professing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> called the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. And I am of opinion, that the world there hath relation to them, in opposition to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who thought that salvation was to be had only among them, and no where else; wherefore Christ tells <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that God did not love the <hi>Jews</hi> only; but the world, <hi>scil.</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also, <hi>that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, By declaring against Universal Redemption, my sence is not to oppose the sufficiency of the merit of the death of Christ for all men; there was price enough in his blood to save ten thousand worlds; far be it from me to derogate from the worth of that satisfaction which Christ did give, when he gave himself for our sins, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I concur with Master <hi>John Goodwin</hi> in this, who saith,</p>

                  <p>I did not think Mr <hi>Erbury</hi> had been so much a stranger to the Scripture, as not to know the contrary, and yet there were such differences, and divisions in judgement betwixt Church and Church in the Apostes days, more material, substantial, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, then any that are this day betwixt the Prelatick, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, and Independent: For example; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was famous for faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. and that of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> for the work of saith, labour of love, and patience of hope, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.3. The Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> on the contrary side held such opinions as destroyed the faith, and rendred the death of Christ ineffectual, in urging receiving, and practising circumcision, and other <hi>Mosaical</hi> ceremonies, as necessary to salvation; See <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. and 3.1,2.

Christ though he had <hi>the Spirit not by measure, Iohn</hi> 3.34. though <hi>anointed with the oyl of gladness above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Heb.</hi> 1.9. and <hi>filled with all the fulness of God, Col.</hi> 2.9. yet prayed, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.28. and prayed before meat, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.36. preached, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.33,34. communicated with his Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. made use of the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17,18,19. directed others to do so, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. How is it then that these duties are cast off, which Christ himself did both practise, and command. What altitudes, or high attainments soever these men dream of, (that cry down Ordinances,) I am afraid they take that to be <hi>Iuno,</hi> which is but a cloud, yea, that to be the Spirits discovery, which is but Satans delusion; and while they conceit themselves to be all spirit, they manifest nothing but flesh.</p>
                  <p>This is the Spirit of Antichrist which began to work in <hi>Johns</hi> time, and appeared in <hi>Zwenkfield,</hi> and his followers, in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> time, who judged of <hi>Luther,</hi> and other faithfull Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of that Age, to be men of a very low strain, that lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a carnal Administration, upon the Letter, and History, not knowing God in Spirit, and in mystery, which is the word of the Manifestarians concerning many worthy Saints in this Age.</p>
                  <p>For my part I can see but little of the image, or appearance of God in such men. And therefore I would advise them to consider two things.</p>
                  <p>First, Whether their present way and walking tends to the Honour of Christ, together with the propagation of his Church, and Gospel? Have the feet of the Messengers of the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of peace appeared once beautiful to you? and must their face be now as hateful? Hath some of you found the Word of God like an open fountain flowing with comforts in greatest
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113080:33"/> troubles, and do you now lay it aside? Have the Ordinances of Christ been unto you more precious then gold, sweeter then honey? and do they now seem unto you, as the waters of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> to <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian?</hi> O consider this ye that forget God, and remember from whence ye are fallen.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consult those dreadful Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4,5,6. &amp; 10.26,27. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20,21,22. And be assured, as it is the life and power of the Gospel, to renew men to the appearance and image of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. so it is the joy and crown of all Gospel Pastors to see it; this is one main end of all our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praying, that men who by nature bear the image of the earthy, may by grace brought to bear the image of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and so be made like our elder Brother Jesus Christ, holy, meek, merciful, obedient, as he is, in resemblance, though not in degree. We shall be so far from being afraid at this sight, that we shall glory, and rejoyce to see it in any, yea in those (if possible) that term themselves the scattered Saints.</p>
                  <p>But here I would ask one thing, What is the reason the Saints are scattered in this age? why do they not gather together, and exercise communion? why are they scattered like sheep having no shepherd: They cannot complain that persecution is the cause of it? they have liberty to an excess. We read of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pilgrims in the first times, who were forced to wander by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of persecution: The primitive Saints <hi>wandred in sheepskins, and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy, they wandred in desarts, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and caves of the earth, Heb.</hi> 11.37,38. But of volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pilgrims, we cannot read, till the fourth Century, at which time they begun, as <hi>Gregory Nyssene,</hi> who then lived, reporteth. In like manner of Saints necessarily scattered we have had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both in former times, and of late years, who wandred even to strange Countries by reason of persecution, but of Saints vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily scattered, I never read till now, nor can I believe the appearance of God to be so visible in them: The appearance of God, and emblem of Heaven, is much more seen in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and gathering together of the Saints; at the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, the Lord did promise to meet his people. <note place="margin">Exod. 29.42.</note> Where a Company of Saints are gathered together,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113080:34"/> we may safely say, there is <hi>the Tabernacle of God with men,</hi> his house and habitation through the Spirit. And it is the mind of God, that the Saints should gather together;</p>

As for Master <hi>Erburies</hi> New-Light, which he hath (not from the Father of Lights, but) from other fallible, and erroneous persons, it is clearly manifest to be nothing but blackness of darkness, whereby not only the Ministry of this, and former times, is grievously traduced, but the Doctrine of the everlasting Covenant miserably corrupted: However my prayer shall be to the God of Truth, and Father of Light, that according to the riches of his Grace, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he would so enlighten the souls, and open the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of his faithful servants, that they may not believe

                  <p>That the Magistrate is the Minister of God, I easily grant, and that from the Authority of the proof quoted in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by Master <hi>Erbury, Rom.</hi> 13.4. but that he is the only Minister of God, I deny. The very same Authority that proves the Magistrate to be the Minister of God, proves Pastors, and Teachers, to be the Gifts, and Ordinances of Christ, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of his Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11,12. But I am glad to see, that Master <hi>Erbury</hi> hath such honourable thoughts of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, as to acknowledge the Divine Institution thereof, and to give him the <hi>Epithite</hi> of Christian; But he cannot say, that there is any Magistrate this day on Earth by an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Call from Heaven, nor do I say, there is any Minister. He acknowledgeth a Church, and a people of God, but no Church-Minister of God, nor any on earth, to whom the Ministry of Christ is any thing revealed.</p>
                  <p>To this I might speak largely; but it is not worth the while, for such monstrous Paradoxes (as these are) I look on only as the Excursions, and Evaporations of a whimsical brain, and no more; And I am confident, that as the asserting of Pastors, and Teachers, to be the Ministers of God, gives no offence to the Christian Magistrates, nor derogates from the Rise and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of their Authority; so should it be in the desires, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all Gospel-Ministers, that they might live to see the images and appearances of God, yet more and more in the Christian Magistrates; that the things of God may be dearest in their eyes, and the height of all their designes be to lift up the great Name of God. Magistrates are called <hi>Gods, Psal.</hi> 82.6. God hath lent them his Chair, and Name; O that they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:113080:38"/> would all remember, whom they do represent. When the rude Souldiers saw the Senators at <hi>Rome</hi> sit gravely in their Robes, they held them Gods, but as soon as one of them grew was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, and froward, they despised them. It will be so with Christian Magistrates; (for the heart of a Christian knows not how to reverence any thing in man, but the image of God:) If they hold themselves to justice, conscience, equity, care of Religion, &amp;c. they will be honoured as Gods; but if they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover nothing but self, fear, passion, partiality, neglect of <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> they do much dishonour God in their callings, and then mens tongues and pens will be bold with the greatest of them.</p>
                  <p>The late Act of Parliament against Ranting, Heresie, and B as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, hath bespoke that Magistracy, honourable, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the eyes of Gods people, and yet do not I stir up the Christian Magistrate against Master <hi>Erbury,</hi> but if he hath not sinned the sin unto death, I pray for his conviction, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, if God peradventure will give him <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.25.</note>
                     <hi>repentance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the Truth.</hi> I contend with him with no other weapon, but the Sword of the Spirit, which (though not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, yet <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4.</note>

               <p>From which may be clearly pickt this <hi>English,</hi> That the Lord General doth only say well, and no more.</p>
               <p>This I do not observe to incense the General against him, but only to discover his censorious humour, that delights to use Spectacles, rather then a Looking-Glass, to behold, and judge others, more by far, then himself.
